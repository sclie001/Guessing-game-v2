# Guessing-game-v2
A highly competitve game where a player tries to guess the correct number. (This is version 2 of the Guessing Game with a more game-like feel)

This project was built to reinforce my knowledge on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Learned to use JavaScript code to dynamically modify HTML and CSS.
